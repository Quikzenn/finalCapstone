                <p class="block-p">It is our passion and our mission to give all the incredibly talented musicians in this country - whether they be just starting out on their
                    journey or years in the making - an open door to showcase to the world their gift. Many of us here at Acoustic Life are musicians and understand
                    how difficult a life of performing can be. So we are here for you, to help open some doors and to help enrich the artistic scene with your talent. </p>

                    <li>To provide an open, friendly, online space for artists to create, communicate with each other and with venue owners or event managers.</li>

                    <li>To try our very best to ensure that the great talent that works away day after day creating great art is not missed and never given 
                        its chance.
