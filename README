This repository is a website built as part of my HyperionDev bootcamp in Web Development. It is a website for an imagined business made to help freelance musicians find
venues to perform at without having to put in the hours networking themselves. Due to task requirements, this website contains a like system, and a save for later
feature, which allows users to save images from the site into another page. It features a fully functional comments section and a mocked up contact us form. The website utilises localStorage to perform these tasks.
